The audits will use Inter-rater reliability reviews of Beneficiary Appeals and Short Stay claims to assess the validity and accuracy of the BFCC-QIOs reviews. The AIRR contractor will also systematically screen medical records for adverse patient safety events that occurred in hospitals and other settings using a standardized process and review each medical record that is positive for an adverse patient safety event to determine “the completeness, adequacy and quality of the care provided.”""","TERMINATED","https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/jsp/viewLinkController.jsp?agencyID=7530&PIID=75FCMC24F0155&modNumber=P00002&idvAgencyID=&idvPIID=GS10F096CA&contractType=AWARD","2/24/2025",11170140,"AWARD","75FCMC24F0155","7530","P00002","","GS10F096CA","75FCMC24F0155","GS10F096CA","Terminate for Convenience (complete or partial)","$0.00","$2,792,535.00",NA,"$0.00","$2,792,535.00",NA,"$0.00",NA,"$13,962,675.00","$0.00",NA
